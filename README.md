QuaverSeries is a live coding environment designed to run the programming language of the same name. It features the concept of ```room``` that allows you to collaborate with your friends all around the world.

## Enter a room

To get started, you need to enter a ```room```. Type a name you like on the top right corner of the index page. If the room is empty, you can create a password to start editing. The next time when you come to the same room, you need to remember your password to edit it.
